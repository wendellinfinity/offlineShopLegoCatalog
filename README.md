======================

Offline Lego Shop catalog for me and my girlfriend's HK trip
: I made this app to solve a problem that we sometimes face during out of country trips, which is the trouble of computing what does an item worth in USD, the country's currency, and our home currency. Yeah of course you can get online and stuff but we want to: save money instead of buying sim cards with unlimited internet (which I will have to swap on my original sim); or also going online on public wifi which is pretty risky considering the data on our mobile phones and we being in a foreign country; and also having to lug around pieces of paper or stuff. So I created this app for the both of us and it stores the entire catalog of shop.lego.com as of the last week of November (no sale prices i hope). It is a master-detail list that when you select an item, it will display it's code, title and the price conversions, ow and the little preview image too.
: It uses Core Data to store the lego items, and is prepackaged with the app
: No online connection is required
: You can scavenge a lot of code from here.
